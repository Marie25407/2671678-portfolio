In this project, I learned how Git helps track changes in a project using version control. I also learned how GitHub allows developers to store and share their code online. Using repositories and commits made it easier to manage my work. Branching showed me how to work on features separately without affecting the main project. These tools are essential for collaboration and professional software development.
